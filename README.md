This Project is an accumulation of 3 of the 7 project components assigned throughout the CSCI 235 (Software Design and Analysis II) semester of FALL 2023. 

This is subject to the same license as Project 7 which was the only project that contained a license.
Project 7 contained BinaryNode.hpp, BinarySearchTree.hpp, BinaryNode.cpp, BinarySearchTree.cpp, Item.hpp, Item.cpp, Inventory.hpp, Inventory.cpp, Item.o, main.cpp, main.o Makefile, gitignore.txt, README.md, LICENSE.md. 
Character.hpp, Mage.hpp, Scoundrel.hpp, Barbarian.hpp, Character.cpp, Mage.cpp, Scoundrel.cpp, Barbarian.cpp are files based on tasks from Projects 1 and 2, however, they are all created by Fardeen Bhuiyan with no previous source code taken from the University, and are thus Fardeen Bhuiyan's property.
